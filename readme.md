```zsh
# omit the plugin repo path to update all plugins
omz update username/repo
```

```zsh
# github username & repo of the plugin
omz remove username/repo

You will still have to remove the plugin from the plugin list manually.

### load a plugin
```zsh
# within your .zshrc (before sourcing oh-my-zsh.sh)
# with the plugin name being the github repo without username
plugins=(
    ...
    plugin-name
)
# OR
# anywhere in the shell
# github username & repo of the plugin
omz load username/repo
```
